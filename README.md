# [Relicstaurants] [build badges go here when available]

> The Relicstaurants repository was created so that you can test New Relic observability on a small but real project. You don't have to create a special application just to practice, we did it for you. So go ahead and copy the repository, run it locally and try to implement observability for this project yourself. You can find a tip on what the finished project looks like on the "observability" branch

## Installation

```
 npm install

```

## Getting Started

```
npm run build
npm run newstart
```

## Usage

> [**Optional** - Include more thorough instructions on how to use the software. This section might not be needed if the Getting Started section is enough. Remove this section if it's not needed.]

## Building

> Because backend of app is already in repository we need to build it manually and then make newstart, that commands will at first build whole application with backend and next will serve it in browser.

## Testing

> [**Optional** - Include instructions on how to run tests if we include tests with the codebase. Remove this section if it's not needed.]
